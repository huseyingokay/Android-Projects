# Android-Projects
Android projects developed by me during my learning process from Udacity/Android Basics Course. 
- HappyBirthdayCardApp is the first app created by me during by learning process (in second term of university). It is a basic app that shows a photo and two strings declared in java codes.
- CountCounter is my first interactive app which can keep basketball points of two teams. User can choose "+3 points", "+2 points" or "free throw" to add points to team a score table or team b score table and reset the scores.
- JustJava is an app that you can create an ice cream order and send an receipt email.
